# Experiment Catalog

This repository contains a collection of projects that are helpful for running experiments and then cataloging them for later comparison. These are the four projects:

- [Catalog](./catalog): The catalog is a C# API that allows you to create projects with experiments. It then allows you to record results on arbitrary metrics and compare them.

- [UI](./ui): The UI for the catalog is a Svelte project. The Catalog project above can host this site.

- [Evaluator](./evaluator): The evaluator is a C# pipeline that allows you to run inference and evaluation jobs at high scale without those services needing to understand the catalog, storage, or queuing.

- [Evaluation](./evaluation): The evaluation project is a Python script that serves as an example of using an LLM as a judge to evaluate the quality of a model.

Click on each of those services above to learn more.

## Enqueue Inference

```bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "project": "project-01", "experiment": "experiment-000", "set": "both", "containers": ["test"], "queue": "pelasne-inference", "iterations": 3 }' http://localhost:6030/api/evaluations
```
