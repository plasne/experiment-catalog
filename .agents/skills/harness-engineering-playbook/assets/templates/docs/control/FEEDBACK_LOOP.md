# Feedback Loop

Define how observations produce corrective actions.

## Loop Steps

1. Measure: capture sensor outputs.
2. Compare: compute error against setpoints.
3. Decide: choose control action.
4. Act: apply change.
5. Verify: re-measure and close the loop.

## Control Frequency

- Fast loop (per change):
- Daily loop:
- Weekly loop:

## Error Budget Policy

- Error budget metric:
- Budget window:
- Budget exhaustion response:
