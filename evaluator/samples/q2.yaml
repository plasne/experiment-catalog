    msg: Can you describe the dawn, day, and dusk phases of Fury of Dracula 4th edition?
ground_truth: >
  Dawn occurs before day, and dusk occurs before night.
  - At dawn, which is after the Dracula phase has ended, the time marker is advanced from its
    current night space to the next day space.
  - At dusk, which is before the hunters take their night actions, the time marker is advanced
    from its current day space to the next night space.
  - When the time marker advances from Sunday night to Monday day, place one despair token on
    the space in the center of the time track. Also, Dracula gains one rumor token.
  - There are event cards that can be played during dawn or dusk. If a character chooses to play
    one of these cards, they do so after the time marker is advanced.
  - If one or more hunters are in the same location as Dracula during dawn or dusk, a combat occurs
    after the time marker is advanced (see the “Round Summary” on page 16).
